## Troubleshooting

- Check browser console for errors
- Test in incognito mode (ad blockers can block GA)

### Build fails
- Check Node.js version (18+ required)
- Delete `node_modules` and `.next`, run `npm install` again
- Check Netlify build logs for specific error

### CSS not loading
- Verify `next.config.js` has correct output settings
- Check file paths are correct
- Hard refresh browser (Cmd+Shift+R or Ctrl+Shift+R)

## Scaling Up

### If traffic grows significantly:

1. **Upgrade Netlify plan** (if needed)
   - Free tier: 100GB bandwidth/month
   - Pro tier: 400GB bandwidth/month ($19/mo)

2. **Add CDN optimization**
   - Netlify includes CDN by default
   - Consider Cloudflare for additional layer

3. **Optimize assets**
   - Compress images (if you add any)
   - Minify CSS/JS (automatic with Next.js)
   - Enable Brotli compression (automatic on Netlify)

4. **Add caching headers**
   - Edit `netlify.toml` to add cache rules

## Backup & Maintenance

### Regular Tasks

**Weekly**:
- Check Google Analytics for issues

- Test affiliate links still work

**Monthly**:
- Update dependencies: `npm update`
- Review and respond to user feedback
- Check for security updates

**Quarterly**:
- Review and optimize affiliate links

- A/B test different CTAs

### Backup

Since this is a static site with no database:
- Code is in Git (GitHub)
- Netlify keeps deployment history
- Environment variables documented in `.env.example`

To backup: Just push to GitHub regularly.
