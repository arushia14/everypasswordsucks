## ðŸ’¡ Using the Data

### Calculate Revenue:
```
Daily Formula:
password_tested Ã— (affiliate_click Ã· password_tested) Ã— 3% Ã— $4

Example with your data:
2,890 tests Ã— (231 clicks Ã· 2,890) Ã— 0.03 Ã— $4 = $27.72/day = $832/month
```

### Optimize Based on Data:

**If bounce rate is high (>60%):**
- Make headline more compelling
- Speed up animation (already 6 seconds)
- Add trust signals

**If CTR is low (<5%):**
- Make affiliate section more prominent
- Improve CTA copy
- Add urgency ("Limited time offer")

**If share rate is low (<2%):**
- Add share incentive
- Improve share copy
- Make buttons more visible

**If traffic is low:**
- Focus on top-performing sources
- Post more frequently
- Improve SEO

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### "I don't see any data"
**Wait 24-48 hours**: Initial data takes time
**Check Realtime**: Should work immediately
**Verify ID**: Check environment variable is correct
**Check ad blockers**: Disable or test in incognito

### "Events not showing"
**Check browser console**: Look for errors
**Verify gtag is loaded**: Type `window.gtag` in console
**Wait 24 hours**: Events take time to appear in reports
**Use Realtime â†’ Events**: Should show immediately

### "Environment variable not working"
**Variable must start with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`**: For browser access
**Redeploy after adding**: Changes need redeployment
**Clear browser cache**: Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R)
