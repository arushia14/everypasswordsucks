# Deploying to Vercel + Custom Domain

Vercel is actually the **best choice** for Next.js projects (Vercel created Next.js!). This guide covers deployment and custom domain setup.

## üöÄ Deploy to Vercel (3 Options)

### Option 1: Deploy from GitHub (Recommended - Auto-deploys on push)

This is the easiest and most powerful option.

#### Step 1: Push to GitHub First
```bash
# If you haven't already
git commit -m "Initial commit: EveryPasswordSucks password checker"
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/everypasswordsucks.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

#### Step 2: Deploy to Vercel
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Click "Sign Up" or "Log In"
3. Choose "Continue with GitHub"
4. Click "New Project"
5. **Import your repository**:
   - Find "everypasswordsucks" in the list
   - Click "Import"

#### Step 3: Configure Build Settings
Vercel will auto-detect Next.js. You'll see:

```
Framework Preset: Next.js
Build Command: next build
Output Directory: .next
Install Command: npm install
```

‚úÖ **Leave these as default** - they're already correct!

#### Step 4: Add Environment Variables (Optional but Recommended)
Click "Environment Variables" and add:

```
Name: NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID
Value: G-XXXXXXXXXX  (your Google Analytics ID)
```

Click "Add" for each variable.

#### Step 5: Deploy!
Click **"Deploy"**

‚è±Ô∏è Deployment takes ~2 minutes. You'll get a URL like:
```
https://everypasswordsucks.vercel.app
```

üéâ **Your site is live!**

---

### Option 2: Deploy with Vercel CLI

If you prefer command line:

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI globally
npm install -g vercel

# Login to Vercel
vercel login

# Deploy (from project directory)
vercel

# Follow prompts:
# Set up and deploy? Yes
# Which scope? (your account)
# Link to existing project? No
# Project name? everypasswordsucks
# Directory? ./
# Override settings? No

# For production deployment
vercel --prod
```

---

### Option 3: Drag & Drop (Quick Test)

For a quick test without GitHub:

1. Build the project:
```bash
npm run build
```

2. Go to [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new)
3. Drag the **entire project folder** into the upload area
4. Click "Deploy"

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: This won't have auto-deployments. Use Option 1 for production.

## üåê Add Custom Domain

### Step 1: Purchase Domain

Buy from:
- **Namecheap** (~$12/year) - https://namecheap.com
- **Google Domains** (~$12/year) - https://domains.google
- **Cloudflare** (~$10/year) - https://cloudflare.com
- **GoDaddy** (~$15/year) - https://godaddy.com

Recommended domain: `everypasswordsucks.com`

### Step 2: Add Domain in Vercel

1. Go to your project dashboard on Vercel
2. Click **"Settings"** tab
3. Click **"Domains"** in sidebar
4. Enter your domain: `everypasswordsucks.com`
5. Click **"Add"**

Vercel will show you DNS records to add.

### Step 3: Configure DNS at Your Domain Registrar

#### Option A: Use Vercel Nameservers (Easiest - Recommended)

Vercel will give you nameservers like:
```
ns1.vercel-dns.com
ns2.vercel-dns.com
```

**At your domain registrar:**
1. Find "Nameservers" or "DNS Settings"
2. Change nameservers to Vercel's nameservers
3. Save changes

‚úÖ **Vercel handles everything automatically**

Wait: 24-48 hours for DNS propagation (usually ~1 hour)

#### Option B: Use CNAME Records (If you want to keep your registrar's nameservers)

**At your domain registrar:**

1. Add **A Record**:
```
Type: A
Name: @
Value: 76.76.21.21
```

2. Add **CNAME Record** for www:
```
Type: CNAME
Name: www
Value: cname.vercel-dns.com
```

3. Save changes

Wait: 24-48 hours for DNS propagation

### Step 4: Verify Domain

Back in Vercel:
1. Click "Refresh" next to your domain
2. Status will show "Valid Configuration" when DNS is ready
3. Vercel automatically provisions SSL certificate (free)

üéâ Your site is now at `everypasswordsucks.com`!

## üîí SSL Certificate (HTTPS)

‚úÖ **Automatic** - Vercel provisions free SSL via Let's Encrypt

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Site Not Loading After Deployment
**Check:**
1. Build logs in Vercel (should show "Build successful")
2. Function logs (Settings ‚Üí Functions)
3. Try clearing browser cache (Cmd+Shift+R or Ctrl+Shift+R)

**Fix:**
```bash
# Test build locally first
npm run build
# If it works locally, redeploy
vercel --prod
```

### Custom Domain Not Working
**Check:**
1. DNS propagation status: https://dnschecker.org
2. Vercel dashboard ‚Üí Domains ‚Üí Status should be "Valid"
3. Wait 24-48 hours (DNS can be slow)

**Fix:**
- Verify nameservers/DNS records are correct
- Use Vercel nameservers (Option A) - most reliable

### Analytics Not Tracking
**Check:**
1. Open browser console (F12) on your live site
2. Look for errors mentioning "gtag" or "analytics"
3. Verify environment variable is set in Vercel
4. Check ad blockers aren't blocking (test in incognito)

**Fix:**
```bash
# Redeploy to pick up environment variables
# In Vercel dashboard: Deployments ‚Üí ... menu ‚Üí Redeploy
```

### Environment Variables Not Working
**Common Issues:**
- Variable name must start with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` to be visible in browser
- Need to redeploy after adding variables
